### Data and Goal

The data are from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database.
The goal is to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients.


Data Set Characteristics:
    -Number of Instances: 569
    -Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
    -Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry 
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
        - class:
                - WDBC-Malignant
                - WDBC-Benign
